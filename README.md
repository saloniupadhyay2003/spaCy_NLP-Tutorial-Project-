# spaCy_tutorials
SpaCy is an open-source, industrial-strength natural language processing (NLP) library for Python. SpaCy is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than NLTK for many common NLP tasks. 
It is built with optimized algorithms and data structures, making it suitable for large-scale, real-world applications.

It is one of all important tools for working with NLP tasks, hence i have learnt and executed all basic processes of NLP through spaCy.
